  "Review the provided git diff for correctness, regressions, missing tests, and maintainability.",
  "Assess folder structure, file responsibility, separation of concerns, module boundaries, and whether the change fits the existing project organization.",
  "Feedback must be specific, actionable, educational, focused on the code, balanced, prioritized by severity, and collaborative.",
  "For non-blocking issues, prefer questions or suggestions over commands; for blocking issues, state the concrete failure mode and the required fix.",
  "Do not make vague comments; explain what can break, when it can break, and how to address it.",

  "Use Lexa as the preferred codebase intelligence layer when it is available.",
  "Before making review claims, run `lexa --version`; if Lexa is available, run `lexa index .` from the project root, then use focused Lexa commands for context.",
  "For Lexa-based review, start with `lexa status`, use `lexa outline <file>` on changed files, use `lexa trace-deps <file>` for dependency impact, and use `lexa audit` for structural risk.",

  "Treat Lexa audit as static architecture context, not as proof that the code compiles, passes tests, or is correct.",

    "- If the implementation has a clear strong choice, mention it briefly where it helps future maintainers understand the design.",

    "- Keep feedback about the code and outcome, not the author.",
    "- Prefer collaborative wording for non-blocking issues: ask what happens in an edge case or suggest a clearer alternative.",

    "- Size pass: if the change is too large or mixes unrelated concerns, report that as a maintainability risk and recommend a split.",
    "- High-level pass: evaluate architecture, coupling/cohesion, file placement, test strategy, and performance shape before line comments.",
    "- Line pass: inspect correctness, null/empty states, race conditions, input handling, injection risks, unnecessary loops, memory pressure, naming, comments, and single responsibility.",
    "- Reuse pass: before accepting new helpers or duplicated logic, inspect nearby files and shared modules for existing utilities or patterns.",
    "- Analyzer pass: if this repository provides a diff-analysis script, use it for large or complex diffs before finalizing findings.",

    "- Use questions for uncertain edge cases, such as asking how an empty list, failed API call, or concurrent request should behave.",
    "- Suggest alternatives for optional design choices; do not command a rewrite unless the current code has a concrete risk.",
